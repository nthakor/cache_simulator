# cache_simulator

We have developed two version of cache simulator. 

- Folder simple_cache contains implementation of cache simulator which takes ways, sets, associativity type and cache size as input and returns hits and misses

- Folder hierarchical_cache contains implementation of hierarchical cache simulator which takes ways, sets, associativity type and cache size as input for all level of caches and returns hits and misses

The input instructions are added for both the files in their respective folders.
