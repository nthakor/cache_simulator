# cache_simulator

This project is part of the course CS 326 Computer Organization at IIT Gandhinagar. We have developed two versions of cache simulator. 

- Folder *simple_cache* contains implementation of cache simulator which takes ways, sets, associativity type and cache size as input and returns hits and misses

- Folder *hierarchical_cache* contains implementation of hierarchical cache simulator which takes ways, sets, associativity type and cache size as input for all level of caches and returns hits and misses

The input instructions are added for both the files in their respective folders.
